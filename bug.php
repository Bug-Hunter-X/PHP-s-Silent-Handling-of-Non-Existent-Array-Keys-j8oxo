In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't explicitly defined.  If you try to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, PHP won't throw an error. Instead, it will return NULL without any warning. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, especially when using the result in further calculations or comparisons. For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
echo $myArray['c']; // Outputs nothing (NULL)
if ($myArray['c'] == 0) { echo 'This condition is true!'; } // This will execute
```

This behavior might not be intuitive for developers coming from other languages where accessing nonexistent array elements would usually trigger an exception.
