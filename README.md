This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in PHP: the silent handling of accessing non-existent array keys.  The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, where accessing an undefined array key returns NULL without any warning. This can cause unexpected behavior, particularly in conditional statements.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides solutions to mitigate this issue.  This is a crucial understanding for writing robust PHP applications.
